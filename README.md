## User Guide

BetterComments is a custom Automation Anywhere package designed to enhance bot documentation and maintainability. It allows you to add multi-line comments and embed images directly in your bot logic.

### Features

- **Multi-line comments:** Create detailed explanations within your bots for better understanding.
- **Image support:** Attach reference images (e.g., diagrams, flows) to make complex logic clearer.
- **No-op behavior:** Commands are non-executingâ€”used purely for annotation purposes.

### Installation

1. Import the `BetterComments.jar` into your Control Room using the **Packages** section.
2. Deploy it to your bots as needed.
3. If build issues occur, refer to the patch instructions below.

### How to Use

- **Add a Comment:** Use the `Add Comment` command and input your descriptive text.
- **Insert an Image:** Use the `Add Image Comment` command and provide the path or base64 string of the image.

> ðŸ“Œ *Tip:* Use comments generously in complex loops or decision structures for better maintainability.
